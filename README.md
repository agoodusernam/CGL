# CGL
Core Graphics Library is a library that I made to make OpenGL simple to code in. /nI'd like to credit GLFW for their library which powers mine.


# How to install CGL for Visual Studio

> ⚠️ **WARNING: GLFW IS REQUIRED**
> Before using CGL you will need to have GLFW installed and ready to go
> We recommend using vcpkg for simplicity if you are using Visual Studio.

## Windows Installing (Visual Studio)

1. For windows you can download the CGL-Installer.exe from one of the releases.
2. Or optionally you can also download the .zip file.
3. After CGL has been downloaded you will make a project in Visual Studio.
4. In the project you will need to include the lib folder as an additional library directory (In the Linker, Input)
5. Do the same for the include folder, but as an additional include directory (In VC++ Directories and C/C++)
6. Also make sure you have downloaded GLFW for this project (unless you used vcpkg, it does that automatically)
7. Now you should have CGL installed and ready to use.
8. If you need any help join the official CGL discord: discord.gg/JrsCsKBDtM
